You've probably heard of Vim, that text editor you fumbled around in during your C programming class in University, or the one your senior engineer uses to to edit 5 files at once on their multi-paned terminal session. 

Vim is notoriously difficult to learn and even so, the people who swear by it will tell you that it's the most efficient way to code. However, I think that the steep learning curve makes it the most *fun* way to code as well.

## Why Gamify Coding?

The simple answer: to code more. There is more to it that that though, but in essence if you can make coding more fun, then you'll code more. And whether you're a professional developer or a hobbyist, coding more is always a good thing. Vim could be the key to your next promotion or finally finishing that side project you've been working on for the past 3 years.

If coding is something you're going to be sinking hundreds or even thousands of hours into, it is criminal to not at least try to make it more fun.

## What is a Game?

Games are incredibly diverse though, let me clarify what I mean by "game". I'm a huge fan of speedrunning, that is, playing a game as fast as possible. I'm also a fan of games that require precision, skill and strategy. Some titles include: Minecraft, League of Legends, and Chess. 

When learnt to speedrun Minecraft, every key press, mouse movement and block placement had to be executed with precision at blazing speeds. It was of course difficult to learn all the tricks and techniques, but the process of learning was fun and getting better was rewarding. I felt cool, skillful and most of all challenged.

League of Legends was less about speed but rather skill and strategy. It is notoriously difficult to master and again, provided a challenge that was rewarding to overcome.

Chess is the quintessential strategy game. Having a plethora of choices and moves, I found myself sticking to the same strategies that worked for me. However, I was always looking for new strategies to try out and new ways to improve my game.

These are the qualities of a game that get me hooked. They are challenging, rewarding and fun.

## Vim as a Game

Vim is a game in the sense that it is challenging, rewarding and fun. It is challenging because it is difficult to learn and even more difficult to master. It is rewarding because it is efficient and powerful. It is fun because it is a game.

There are controls to learn, techniques to master and strategies to employ. You can play the game of Vim in many ways. You can play it as a speedrun, trying to edit files as fast as possible. You can play it as a strategy game, trying to find the most efficient way to edit a file. You can play it as a precision game, trying to make as few mistakes as possible.

<!-- ## Efficiency and Speed -->
<!---->
<!-- At the heart of Vim's philosophy is the idea of minimizing keystrokes to achieve maximum efficiency. -->
<!---->
<!-- Unlike other text editors where the mouse is often relied upon for navigation and text manipulation, Vim's keyboard-centric design allows developers to perform virtually all coding tasks without leaving the home row. This not only speeds up coding but also reduces the risk of repetitive strain injuries. -->
<!---->
<!-- ## Highly Customizable -->
<!---->
<!-- Vim can be extensively customized to suit any developer's preferences and workflow. With a vibrant ecosystem of plugins and a robust scripting language, users can tailor the editor to their specific needs, whether it's programming in Python, writing in Markdown, or managing projects. -->
<!---->
<!-- This level of customization ensures that Vim remains relevant and highly functional for a wide range of programming tasks and languages. -->
<!---->
<!-- ## Ubiquity and Portability -->
<!---->
<!-- Vim is virtually everywhere. It's available on all major platforms, and because it's lightweight and terminal-based, it can be used on remote servers through SSH, making it an indispensable tool for sysadmins and developers working in a cloud-based environment. -->
<!---->
<!-- The ability to use the same editor across different systems without a graphical interface is a significant advantage for those who need to maintain a consistent workflow across multiple environments. -->
<!---->
<!-- ## Vibrant Community -->
<!---->
<!-- Despite—or perhaps because of—its learning curve, Vim has cultivated a passionate and active community. Online forums, dedicated websites, and plugins abound, offering support, advice, and improvements. -->
<!---->
<!-- This community not only helps newcomers climb the steep learning curve but also continually contributes to Vim's evolution, ensuring it remains adaptable and up-to-date with the latest programming trends and technologies. -->
<!---->
<!-- ## Conclusion -->
<!---->
<!-- Vim is not just a text editor; it's a way of approaching coding with efficiency and thoughtfulness. Its steep learning curve is a small price to pay for the speed, flexibility, and control it offers. -->
<!---->
<!-- For those willing to invest the time to master its commands, Vim proves to be an invaluable tool that enhances productivity and enjoyment in coding. In an age of ever-changing development tools, the continued popularity of Vim is a testament to its enduring value and utility. --> */}
